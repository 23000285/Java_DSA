Yes! Below are two simple Java programs that demonstrate:

* **An advantage of multithreading**: performing tasks in parallel to save time.
* **A disadvantage of multithreading**: data inconsistency without proper synchronization.

## ✅ **Advantage Example: Faster Execution with Threads**

```java
class MyTask extends Thread {
    public void run() {
        for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
            System.out.println(getName() + " - Task " + i);
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyTask t1 = new MyTask();
        MyTask t2 = new MyTask();
        t1.start();
        t2.start();
        System.out.println("Main thread finished!");
    }
}
```

### 🔹 Output may vary:

```
Main thread finished!
Thread-0 - Task 1
Thread-1 - Task 1
Thread-0 - Task 2
Thread-1 - Task 2
...
```

🔸 **Advantage shown**: Both tasks run **simultaneously**, saving time and keeping the application responsive.

## ❌ **Disadvantage Example: Data Inconsistency (No Synchronization)**

```java
class Counter {
    int count = 0;

    void increment() {
        count++;
    }
}

class MyThread extends Thread {
    Counter counter;

    MyThread(Counter counter) {
        this.counter = counter;
    }

    public void run() {
        for (int i = 1; i <= 1000; i++) {
            counter.increment();
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
        Counter c = new Counter();
        MyThread t1 = new MyThread(c);
        MyThread t2 = new MyThread(c);
        t1.start();
        t2.start();
        t1.join();
        t2.join();
        System.out.println("Final Count: " + c.count);
    }
}
```

### 🔹 Expected Output:

```
Final Count: <less than 2000>
```

🔸 **Disadvantage shown**: Due to **race condition**, the final count may be **less than 2000**.
