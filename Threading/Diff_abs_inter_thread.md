In Java threading, **abstraction** and **interface** play different roles when it comes to how threads are implemented. The two main ways to implement threads in Java are:

1. **Extending the `Thread` class** (which is an example of abstraction — using an abstract class)
2. **Implementing the `Runnable` interface**

Here's the **difference** between the two in the context of threading:

---

### 🔹 1. **Using Abstraction (Extending Thread class)**

```java
class MyThread extends Thread {
    public void run() {
        // thread logic
    }
}
```

#### ✅ Pros:

* Simpler to write if you don’t need to extend any other class.
* You can directly use `this.start()` inside the class.

#### ❌ Cons:

* **Java doesn’t support multiple inheritance**, so you can’t extend another class if you already extend `Thread`.

---

### 🔹 2. **Using Interface (Implementing Runnable)**

```java
class MyRunnable implements Runnable {
    public void run() {
        // thread logic
    }
}
```

Then use:

```java
Thread t = new Thread(new MyRunnable());
t.start();
```

#### ✅ Pros:

* **Better for OOP**: You can extend another class, and still implement Runnable.
* Encourages separation of task (`Runnable`) and thread management (`Thread`).
* Preferred in **modern Java** (also for using `ExecutorService`).

#### ❌ Cons:

* Slightly more verbose for beginners.

### ⚖️ Summary Table:

| Aspect                 | `Thread` (Abstraction)    | `Runnable` (Interface)          |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Inheritance            | Extends `Thread` class    | Implements `Runnable` interface |
| Multiple inheritance   | ❌ Not possible            | ✅ Possible                      |
| Flexibility            | Less flexible             | More flexible                   |
| Recommended for OOP    | ❌                         | ✅                               |
| Separation of concerns | ❌ Thread = Task + Control | ✅ Task is separate from Thread  |

### 💡 Best Practice:

Use **`Runnable` interface** for better design and flexibility, especially in real-world applications or when using **Executor Framework**.
