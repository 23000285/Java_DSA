<h1>BackTracking</h1>

<dt>Definition:</dt>
<dd>
    Backtracking is a method of solving problems by trying out possible solutions and reversing (backtracking) when a solution path fails, similar to double-checking each choice step-by-step. It efficiently explores all valid possibilities.

Backtracking usually uses recursion, but it is not limited to recursion only.
It can also be implemented iteratively using a stack, but recursion naturally handles the stack mechanism, making it simpler for backtracking problems.
